# major-project(donkey kong 1981)

## description:

I plan to make a version of the original donkey kong game from 1981 with each stage working with the barrels,  enimies(trouble bugs) and the player. I would ideally like to have the project as close to the origional quality as possible and would hope to make it free of glitches. 
   

## must haves:

* working interactions between the terrain, the player, and the enimies, and the ladders

* functional gameplay

* records of the score (json)

* resetting the levels after the player wins or dies

* working life system i.e x lives remaining 

## extras I would like to add

* all 4 stages in the original nintendo 1981 arcade version 

* sound effects 
* smaller animations such as for the enimies and barrels and level generation (when DonkeyKong jumps around)
* all knownbugs exterminated
